todo:
- create fire pit entity [done]
- create tree [done]
 - make trees impassible [done]
- pressing space near tree punches the tree [done]
  - if tree has apple (visible on it) then player grabs apple [done]
  - if tree has no apple, player grabs stick (infinite for now) [done]
- player can grab and place down stick, if player places down stickwood on fire pit, fire pit ignites [done]
- pressing space near ignited fire pit gives stick on fire [done]
- walking with stick on fire near unlit candle ignites candle, uses up the stick [done]
- once all candles a lit and everything is in place, (overworld) ritual is complete [done]
after player completes overworld ritual, fades into ghost world and has to complete ghost ritual
test and make sure now that replay system works correctly and completely (BEFORE working on ghost world)
  make sure replay system also captures ritual site business...
ritual site adjacent to overworld site, similar but different signs (skulls instead of apples)
ghost player can only move near physical player and map center (ritual sites), create darkness effect anywhere that is away from physical player
  ghost player simply can not move out of radius away from physical player, is dragged along with phys player if too far and phys player moves
collect skulls from around the forest, can only move with phys player and collect skulls near him
create effects system (not saved by replay system)
  create fade in and fade out effects
  smoke pillars emerging for lit fire pit and lit candles and lit sticks (if held by player, then from player's location)
ritual site energy effects (spreading out from center of ritual site and strongly approaching slots that are set correctly)
